# Public-Health-Research-Information-Tool

**This tool pulls research abstracts from the NCBI databases and stores in a relational database for analysis of large stores of research findings.**

**What Is It?** 
A tool that automates: a. the creation of an MS SQL database for storage of abstracts from Pubmed and other databases; b. large-scale querying from Pubmed's API; c. the storage of pulled queries in relational tables.

**Who Would Use This?** 
We think this tool is particularly useful to those working domains of applied public health / public policy research, policymaking, community outreach, and program design and implementation.  

**What Can This Tool Do?** 
The idea of this tool is to expand your view of the published peer reviewed literature relevant to the work you do, by facilating capture of "the universe" of literature relevant to your work, and enabling you to mine that literature data.  It should augment traditional literature review approaches and may potentially be used to conduct novel analysis, such as automated meta-analysis of related studies.  It can also be used to monitor when an author of interest, or group of authors of interest, publish new findings. 

**How Can I get Started?**  
Step through the Wiki pages in this repo and follow the instructions.  It's easy! Note that we have currently uploaded code to automate the creation of an MS SQL database.  You will need to have access and write priveleges to such a database before you begin. We will post the code and instructions for Access database design in the near future. 

**Then What? ** 
We hope that as you and others start to use this tool, you will branch off the repo and share code for the analyses you do off the data in your database.  The advantage to this model is that as you do that, others can take advantage of your insights on how to analyze and visualize abstract data. A unique aspect of this code repository model is that all users will work from a standardized data structure.  We think this will streamline the information and idea sharing process.
